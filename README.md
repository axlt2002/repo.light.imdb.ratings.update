# Light IMDb Ratings Update

Light IMDb Ratings Update is a Kodi add-on that runs as a service to update the ratings, votes and Top 250 for Movies as well as the ratings and votes for TV Shows (including Episodes) by scraping the data from the IMDb site. The update can be run manually or scheduled once a week and it will run as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed. Light IMDb Ratings Update requires the presence of the IMDb IDs for the Movies, TV Shows and Episodes you want to be updated. Light IMDb Ratings Update is compatible with Kodi 17/18 and runs on every platform. Please check the add-on thread in the Kodi forum for more details.
